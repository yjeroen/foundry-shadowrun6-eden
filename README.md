## System Screenshots
> The character sheet now has an updated monitor experience! If you click on the coloured boxes, you get that much damage, and when you click on a white box you get healed unto that box. Stun overflow goes to Physical, and Physical into your Overflow. _In simple terms, don't get fragged._

> Edge coin flips?! Left ⇑ and right ⇓ click.

> You can **still import** your RPGFramework [GENESIS](https://www.rpgframework.de/en/roleplaying/shadowrun-6/) and [Commlink6](https://www.rpgframework.de/en/2022/10/07/commlink-6/) characters! Print to `Shadowrun 6 Foundry Export`, and in FoundryVTT right click on your actor and choose `Import Data`.
